      abstract: "The number of everyday Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices is projected to grow to the billions in the coming decade, which enables various smart building applications. These applications, especially in-home long-term occupant monitoring, rely on the emerging non-intrusive sensing techniques. The acquired IoT sensing data are often of varying data efficiency/quality due to the system and/or deployment constraints, and sensing data distributions can change significantly under different sensing conditions. Therefore, from the data/learning perspective, accurate information learning through pure data-driven approaches requires a large amount of labeled data, which is costly and difficult to obtain in real-world applications. We address these challenges by combining physical and data-driven knowledge to reduce label data needed via physical knowledge-guided model transfer. In this talk, we use structural vibration-based occupant sensing applications to evaluate our model transfer schemes."

        abstract: 
            "Artificial intelligence powered by deep neural networks has reached a level of complexity where it can be difficult or impossible to express how a model makes its decisions. This black-box problem is especially concerning when the model makes decisions with consequences for human well-being. In response, an emerging field called explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to increase the interpretability, fairness, and transparency of machine learning. In this talk I will describe how cognitive psychologists can make contributions to XAI. The human mind is also a black box, and cognitive 
            psychologists have over one hundred and fifty years of experience modeling it through experimentation. We aim to translate the methods and rigour of cognitive psychology to the study of artificial black boxes in the service of explainability. 


            The outline of the talk is as follows: I will provide a review of XAI for non-experts, arguing that current methods possess a blind spot that can be complemented by the experimental cognitive tradition. I will then provide a framework for research in XAI, and highlight exemplary cases of experimentation within XAI inspired by psychological science. Today's XAI methods rely on access to model architecture and parameters that is not always feasible for most users, practitioners, and regulators. I will end the talk by describing a psychology-inspired technique that uses response times (RTs). RTs are observable without privileged access to the model. Moreover, dynamic inference models performing conditional computation generate variable RTs for visual learning tasks. These depend on how the hierarchy of features learned by the network are utilized in prediction. I will show how this method can cast a light on deep neural nets without opening up the black box."

        abstract: 
            "Modern object detection has relentlessly pursued perfection on a single metric: mean average precision, with impressive gains in performance across datasets and sensor types over that last few years.   I will discuss our multiple contributions in this domain, particularly in 3D object detection with monocular, stereo and LIDAR/camera fusion.  Our work has regularly topped the Kitti Vision Benchmark, and emphasizes the value of attention focused on object shape to enhance localization and extent estimation.

            Despite the strong progress in this domain, current network outputs are primarily deterministic, providing little visibility beyond class confidence as to the probability a detection is accurate.  This makes current object detectors a black box for downstream processes such as tracking and prediction, and can lead to over confidence in low-quality detection.  To help address this challenge, I will discuss our recent work on probabilistic object detectors (PODs) on two fronts.  First, I will describe efforts to place the evaluation of PODs on a secure footing, by introducing proper scoring rules with both local and global extent that can determine whether a predictive distribution is both well calibrated and discriminative.  Then, I will discuss our work BayesOD,  a novel probabilistic object detector that exhibits strong output distribution prediction capabilities and outperforms existing PODs in terms of calibration and sharpness."

            "Cameras are now used for many purposes beyond taking photographs. Example applications include remote medical diagnosis, crop monitoring, 3d reconstruction, document recognition, and many more. For such applications, it is desirable to have a camera act as a sensor that directly measures scene light. The problem, however, is that most commodity cameras apply a number of camera-specific processing steps to the captured image in order to produce visually pleasing photos. As a result, different cameras produce noticeably different colors when imaging the exact same scene. This is problematic for applications relying on color because algorithms developed using images from one camera often will not work with images captured on another camera due to color differences. In this talk, I’ll discuss the current state of  affairs for color on commodity cameras, common incorrect assumptions made in the scientific literature regarding image color, and recent developments that are helping to improve the situation."

        abstract: 
            "Segmentation of images is an essential part of many computer vision problems. It is important for biomedical imaging, 3D reconstruction, motion analysis, scene understanding, autonomous driving, etc. In particularly simple cases, the problem may be trivially solved by independent processing of pixels (e.g. thresholding), but more typically segmentation is an ill-posed problem requiring additional constraints to compensate for data ambiguities. Such regularization constraints may represent prior knowledge on shape, geometry, topology, structure, or physical properties of segmented objects. This talk discusses standard and some newer objectives (loss functions) for image segmentation, their optimization methods, limitations, and reviews their use in unsupervised and weakly-supervised settings, including semantic CNN segmentation."

        abstract: 
            "In the past couple years, developments in Artificial Intelligence have captured the public imagination. Google and Facebook are designing systems that understand images well enough to describe them in words. Neural networks can translate language as well as trained experts, idioms and innuendos included. Even artistic pursuits, the supposed privilege of homo sapiens, are being encroached by the burgeoning field of Computational Creativity.
 
            But how do these powerful technologies manifest themselves in practice?  Taking an industry-centric approach, we’ll examine such questions as:
            
            - What do these technologies portend for enterprise clients?  For example, for financial services?
            
            - What are some of the concerns around their adoption?
            
            - How do such tools integrate with other enterprise technologies, such as Big Data?
            
            - What role do ethics play in developing such systems?

            "The ubiquity and accessibility of computing power has given rise to its use in many data-rich applications and sectors. One example of these applications is medicine which has seen a surge of efforts in implementation of machine learning to automate the diagnostic process. It is true that some fields of medicine have substantially benefited from such implementation of machine learning. Advanced algorithms have been utilized to observe and detect features that are not readily accessible to naked eyes, differentiate between similar cases resulting in different patient outcome, predicting immanent  catastrophic health events, and in general assimilating a large volume of seemingly unrelated data  to extract meaningful information that could then aid a physician in performing clinical diagnosis. In this talk, I will outline some of the innovative ways that artificial intelligence is being used in medicine to do some truly amazing things. While these approaches may often times seem far superior to a trained human physician in terms of diagnostic performance, I will argue that we will not be getting our medical diagnosis from a robot wearing a lab coat any time soon!"

        abstract: 
            "Computer vision systems are beginning to rival human vision for certain tasks.  However, there are still many ways in which human and machine vision systems are divergent.  While most single-view computer vision algorithms are 2D in nature, humans find it almost impossible to see in 2D:  an innate 3D sense seems to provide the perceptual scaffolding for our understanding of the world around us.   A second divergence concerns the way we learn.  Most computer vision learning is supervised, and the resulting systems, once trained, do not adapt.  Human perception, on the other hand, appears to be extremely adaptive over many time scales.  In this talk James will describe recent research in our lab on single-view scene analysis that attempts to embrace these principles of 3D adaptive perception.  Specifically he will review how these principles have led to recent progress on the problems of online camera pose estimation, roadway analytics and crowd estimation."
